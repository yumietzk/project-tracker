# Project Tracker

[View Demo here](https://project-tracker-myapp.herokuapp.com/)

A project tracker app built with MERN stack (Mongo DB, Express, React JS, Node.js).  
I used Firebase for user authentication. After users log in, they can create a new project and manage it. This app allows users to show and manage all projects by status and all tasks and due dates of each project for time management.  
I also used React Final Form for form validation in Login & Signup pages.

## How To Use

After logging in, users go to a projects page.

### Create a new project

Users can create a new project by clicking a plus button on top right. Users must include title, date created, status, due date and description. After clicking a create button, they can see a new project on a projcts page.

In a tasks page, users can see and manage tasks in each project except for completed projects. Users can manage tasks by clicking a checkbox besides each task to check or uncheck.

### Check time manage

In a time manage page, users can check each project's due date and how many tasks are left with a timeline calendar and a table. Users can sort projects by due date and also can check the detail of projects. And a fire icon notifies users the project either approaches to the due date or already passes the due date.

### **_Bonus - Dark Mode!_**

If you like a dark mode, you can try it by toggling a top left button!
