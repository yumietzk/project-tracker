A project tracker app built with MERN stack (Mongo DB, Express, React JS, Node.js).  
I used Firebase for user authentication. After users log in, they can create a new project and manage it. This app allows users to show and manage all projects by status and all tasks and due dates of each project for time management.  

### To log in  
Use below login email and password, or sign in as a new user.
